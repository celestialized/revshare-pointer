## Overview

[Web Monetization](https://webmonetization.org) functions really well when you
want to get paid for content you make. But content can rarely be attributed to
a single person. Revshare Pointer is a service that anyone can run which
receives money and immediately forwards it out to one or more different payment
pointers. You can specify the percentages through a graphical interface when
you create a revshare payment pointer.

## TODOs

- [x] Implement revshare pointer creation API
- [x] revshare stream payment forwarding
- [ ] web GUI to create revshare pointers
- [ ] instructions on how to run your own revshare pointer server
- [ ] authentication to modify/delete revshare pointers
